Impact of Batch Processing, Material Movement, and Handling on Assembly Line Calculations
Your questions touch on important real-world factors that can significantly impact assembly line calculations. Let me address each one:
1. Batch Processing (12 pcs/dozen)
Processing in batches of 12 pieces would affect calculations in several ways:
Impact on Calculations

Setup Time Distribution: Any setup time gets distributed across 12 units, reducing per-unit setup time
Batch Efficiency: Some operations become more efficient when performed as a batch
Cycle Time Concept: Changes from "time per piece" to "time per batch ÷ 12"

Numerical Impact
Assuming:

5 minutes batch setup time
10% reduction in processing time due to batch efficiency
Original work content: 37.57 minutes per unit

New calculations:

Setup time per unit: 5 ÷ 12 = 0.42 min/unit
Processing time: 37.57 × 0.9 = 33.81 min/unit
New total work content: 34.23 min/unit

This would increase output by about 10% with the same number of operators.
2. Material Movement Time (1-2 seconds between steps)
Adding 1-2 seconds of movement time between operations:
Impact on Calculations

Additional Time: Each movement adds overhead
Total Work Content Increase: For 64 operations, we have 63 movements

Numerical Impact
Using 2 seconds (0.033 minutes) per movement:

Additional movement time: 63 × 0.033 = 2.08 minutes
New total work content: 37.57 + 2.08 = 39.65 minutes

This would decrease output by about 5% with the same operators.
3. Material Handling Overhead (15% of work content)
If material handling requires an additional 15% of work content:
Impact on Calculations

Additional Work: 15% more work content needs to be distributed
Additional Operators: More operators needed to handle this overhead

Numerical Impact

Additional work content: 37.57 × 15% = 5.64 minutes
Additional operators needed: 5.64 ÷ 2.0 (cycle time) = 2.82 → 3 additional operators

To maintain the same output with material handling overhead, you would need approximately 3 more operators (from 17 to 20 total).
Combined Impact
If we consider all three factors together:

Batch processing: 34.23 min/unit
Movement time: +2.08 minutes
Material handling: +5.13 minutes (15% of 34.23)

Combined total work content: 41.44 min/unit
Options:

Keep 17 operators: Output decreases to ~942 units/week
Add 3 operators (to 20): Maintain or slightly increase original output

Implementation in the Tool
To incorporate these factors into the assembly line balancing tool:

For batch processing: Add a batch size input and setup time input
For movement time: Add a movement time per operation input
For material handling: Add a material handling overhead percentage
